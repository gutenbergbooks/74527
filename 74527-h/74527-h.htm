      <div class='line'>How like a dream the past floats back: it seems</div>
      <div class='line'>But yesterday when I lay tossing upon</div>
      <div class='line'>My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through</div>
      <div class='line'>Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins.</div>
      <div class='line'>And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all</div>
      <div class='line'>The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life</div>
      <div class='line'>Its glow and flush; and thus day after day</div>
      <div class='line'>Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,</div>
      <div class='line'>The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Floated into my room, and then I longed once more</div>
      <div class='line'>To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a familiar friend, whose absence long</div>
      <div class='line'>Had made a mournful void within the heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>I summoned to my side my maids, and bade</div>
      <div class='line'>Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead</div>
      <div class='line'>Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary</div>
      <div class='line'>Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather</div>
      <div class='line'>Healing from the sacred stream.</div>
      <div class='line'>I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found</div>
      <div class='line'>New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves</div>
      <div class='line'>And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet</div>
      <div class='line'>Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw</div>
      <div class='line'>A little wicker-basket hidden among</div>
      <div class='line'>The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called</div>
      <div class='line'>My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring me that little ark which floats beside</div>
      <div class='line'>The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed</div>
      <div class='line'>With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;</div>
      <div class='line'>His little hand amid his clustering curls,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.</div>
      <div class='line'>He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet the welcome of the mother’s kiss,</div>
      <div class='line'>When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back</div>
      <div class='line'>With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment</div>
      <div class='line'>Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved</div>
      <div class='line'>That I would brave my father’s wrath and save</div>
      <div class='line'>The child; but while I stood gazing upon</div>
      <div class='line'>His wondrous beauty, I saw beside me</div>
      <div class='line'>A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me</div>
      <div class='line'>With an eager, questioning look, and drawing</div>
      <div class='line'>Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”</div>
      <div class='line'>I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose</div>
      <div class='line'>Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing</div>
      <div class='line'>With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe</div>
      <div class='line'>Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And the babe nestled there like one at home,</div>
      <div class='line'>While o’er the dimples of his face rippled</div>
      <div class='line'>The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well</div>
      <div class='line'>Content to leave him in her care; and well</div>
      <div class='line'>Did she perform her part. When many days had</div>
      <div class='line'>Passed she brought the child unto the palace;</div>
      <div class='line'>And one morning, while I sat toying with</div>
      <div class='line'>His curls and listening to the prattle of his</div>
      <div class='line'>Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,</div>
      <div class='line'>Saw me bending o’er the child and said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Charmian, whose child is this? who of my lords</div>
      <div class='line'>Calls himself father to this goodly child?</div>
      <div class='line'>He surely must be a happy man.”</div>
      <div class='line in10'>Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a</div>
      <div class='line'>Hebrew child that I have saved from death.” He</div>
      <div class='line'>Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder</div>
      <div class='line'>Had stung him, and said, “Charmian, take that</div>
      <div class='line'>Child hence. How darest thou bring a member</div>
      <div class='line'>Of that mean and servile race within my doors?</div>
      <div class='line'>Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose</div>
      <div class='line'>Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then kneeling at his feet, and catching</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled</div>
      <div class='line'>The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has</div>
      <div class='line'>Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy</div>
      <div class='line'>Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has</div>
      <div class='line'>A claim upon thy mercy.”</div>
      <div class='line in28'>“Charmian,” he said</div>
      <div class='line'>“I have decreed that every man child of that</div>
      <div class='line'>Hated race shall die. The oracles have said</div>
      <div class='line'>The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from them a star shall rise whose light shall</div>
      <div class='line'>Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why</div>
      <div class='line'>I root them from the land; their strength is weakness</div>
      <div class='line'>To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,</div>
      <div class='line'>Give me up the child, and let him die.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then clasping the child closer to my heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>I said, “the pathway to his life is through my own;</div>
      <div class='line'>Around that life I throw my heart, a wall</div>
      <div class='line'>Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder</div>
      <div class='line'>Clouds of distant lands became my father’s brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager</div>
      <div class='line'>Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come</div>
      <div class='line'>Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted</div>
      <div class='line'>Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother</div>
      <div class='line'>Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath</div>
      <div class='line'>Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my home; the star that faded out too</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life</div>
      <div class='line'>To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not thine, I’ll spare the child.” And thus I saved</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee twice—once from the angry sword and once</div>
      <div class='line'>From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art</div>
      <div class='line'>Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such</div>
      <div class='line'>I claim thee now. I’ve nursed no other child</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other</div>
      <div class='line'>Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,</div>
      <div class='line'>With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a painful silence, a silence</div>
      <div class='line'>So hushed and still that you might have almost</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick</div>
      <div class='line'>Throbbing of the other’s heart: for Moses,</div>
      <div class='line'>He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent</div>
      <div class='line'>With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed</div>
      <div class='line'>Her full heart into her lips; but there was</div>
      <div class='line'>Firmness in the young man’s choice, and he beat back</div>
      <div class='line'>The opposition of her lips with the calm</div>
      <div class='line'>Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.</div>

      <div class='line'>God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Led by his faith in God alone; and she would</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell us,—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I, her last, her loved and precious child;</div>
      <div class='line'>She would tell us that one day our father</div>
      <div class='line'>Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer</div>
      <div class='line'>Up in sacrifice the only son of his</div>
      <div class='line'>Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,</div>
      <div class='line'>But he resolved to give his son to God</div>
      <div class='line'>As a burnt offering upon Moriah’s mount;</div>
      <div class='line'>That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning</div>
      <div class='line'>Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand</div>
      <div class='line'>Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold</div>
      <div class='line'>Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Its fearful test. And then she would tell us</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,</div>
      <div class='line'>That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,</div>
      <div class='line'>Would break our chains, and bring to us a great</div>
      <div class='line'>Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds</div>
      <div class='line'>Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then she would lift her eyes unto the far</div>
      <div class='line'>Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs</div>
      <div class='line'>Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within</div>
      <div class='line'>That promised land; and now I feel the hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Of men who have waded through slaughter</div>
      <div class='line'>To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men</div>
      <div class='line'>Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads</div>
      <div class='line'>That lay between them and a throne; but I</div>
      <div class='line'>Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,</div>
      <div class='line'>The splendor of a palace for the squalor</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a hut, and casting down a diadem</div>
      <div class='line'>To wear a servile badge.</div>
      <div class='line in22'>Sadly she gazed</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith and high resolves—the dark prophetic eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Which seemed to look beyond the present pain</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Unto the future greatness of his race.</div>
      <div class='line'>As she stood before him in the warm</div>
      <div class='line'>Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the bright tropical blood sent its quick</div>
      <div class='line'>Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which</div>
      <div class='line'>Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.</div>
      <div class='line'>Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er her face as she stood slowly crushing</div>
      <div class='line'>With unconscious hand the golden tassels</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her crimson robe. She had known life only</div>
      <div class='line'>By its brightness, and could not comprehend</div>
      <div class='line'>The grandeur of the young man’s choice; but she</div>
      <div class='line'>Felt her admiration glow before the earnest</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith that tore their lives apart and led him</div>
      <div class='line'>To another destiny. She had hoped to see</div>
      <div class='line'>The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred</div>
      <div class='line'>Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat</div>
      <div class='line'>The throne of the proud Pharaoh’s; but now her</div>
      <div class='line'>Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang</div>
      <div class='line'>Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,</div>
      <div class='line'>She to brood in silence o’er her pain, and he</div>
      <div class='line'>To take his mission from the hands of God</div>
      <div class='line'>And lead his captive race to freedom.</div>
      <div class='line'>With silent lips but aching heart she bowed</div>
      <div class='line'>Her queenly head and let him pass, and he</div>
      <div class='line'>Went forth to share the fortune of his race,</div>
      <div class='line'>Esteeming that as better far than pleasures</div>
      <div class='line'>Bought by sin and gilded o’er with vice.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>And he had chosen well, for on his brow</div>
      <div class='line'>God poured the chrism of a holy work.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus anointed he has stood a bright</div>

      <div class='line'>It was a great change from the splendor, light</div>
      <div class='line'>And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts</div>
      <div class='line'>Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.</div>
      <div class='line in28'>As he passed</div>
      <div class='line'>Into the outer courts of that proud palace,</div>
      <div class='line'>He paused a moment just to gaze upon</div>
      <div class='line'>The scenes ’mid which his early life had passed—</div>
      <div class='line'>The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The statues breathing music soft and low</div>
      <div class='line'>To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur</div>
      <div class='line'>From their stony beds—the sphynxes gaunt and grim,</div>
      <div class='line'>With unsolved riddles on their lips—and all</div>
      <div class='line'>The bright creation’s painters art and sculptors</div>
      <div class='line'>Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth</div>
      <div class='line'>And dance, and revelry, and song had chased</div>
      <div class='line'>With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>He was leaving all; but no regrets came</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a shadow o’er his mind, for he had felt</div>
      <div class='line'>The quickening of a higher life, as if his</div>
      <div class='line'>Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet there was a tender light in those</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous</div>
      <div class='line'>Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled</div>
      <div class='line'>On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty</div>
      <div class='line'>Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on</div>
      <div class='line'>Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.</div>
      <div class='line'>There he saw the women of his race kneading</div>
      <div class='line'>Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham</div>
      <div class='line'>Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw</div>
      <div class='line'>The increasing pallor on his sisters cheek,</div>
      <div class='line'>The deepening shadows on his mother’s brow,</div>
      <div class='line'>The restless light that glowed in Aaron’s eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if a hidden fire were smouldering</div>
      <div class='line'>In his brain; and bending o’er his mother</div>
      <div class='line'>In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve come to share the fortunes of my race,—</div>
      <div class='line'>To dwell within these lowly huts,—to wear</div>
      <div class='line'>The badge of servitude and toil, and eat</div>
      <div class='line'>The bitter bread of penury and pain.”</div>
      <div class='line'>A sudden light beamed from his mother’s eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she said, “How’s this, my son? but yesterday</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun</div>
      <div class='line'>But dared not enter, only they had heard</div>
      <div class='line'>That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst</div>
      <div class='line'>Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy knee to Egypt’s vain and heathen worship,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst</div>
      <div class='line'>Be engrafted in Pharaoh’s regal line,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter.</div>
      <div class='line'>When thy father Amram heard the cruel news</div>
      <div class='line'>He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I had stronger faith than that. By faith</div>
      <div class='line'>I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh</div>
      <div class='line'>Were searching ’mid our quivering heart strings</div>
      <div class='line'>Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove</div>
      <div class='line'>The rushes of thine ark and laid thee ’mid</div>
      <div class='line'>The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw</div>
      <div class='line'>The answer to that faith when Pharaoh’s daughter</div>
      <div class='line'>Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child</div>
      <div class='line'>For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard</div>
      <div class='line'>As idle words the cruel news that stabbed</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy father like a sword.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords</div>
      <div class='line'>And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;</div>
      <div class='line'>The temple of the sun was opened. Isis</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>And Osiris were unveiled before the people,</div>
      <div class='line'>Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;</div>
      <div class='line'>The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;</div>
      <div class='line'>The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then sank in cadences so soft and low</div>
      <div class='line'>Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.</div>
      <div class='line'>The priests of On were there, with sacred palms</div>
      <div class='line'>Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their</div>
      <div class='line'>Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting</div>
      <div class='line'>In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear</div>
      <div class='line'>Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear</div>
      <div class='line'>Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On</div>
      <div class='line'>Drew near to lay their hands upon my head</div>
      <div class='line'>And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us</div>
      <div class='line'>All,’ that henceforth I’d forswear my kindred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tribe and race; would have no other gods</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted</div>
      <div class='line'>Into Pharaoh’s royal line, and be called</div>
      <div class='line'>The son of Pharaoh’s daughter. Then, mother</div>
      <div class='line'>Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat</div>
      <div class='line'>Beside thee, my lips apart with childish</div>
      <div class='line'>Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy</div>
      <div class='line'>Glowing face, and my young soul gathering</div>
      <div class='line'>Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,</div>
      <div class='line'>The blessed hopes and glorious promises</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>That weave their golden threads among the sombre</div>
      <div class='line'>Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid</div>
      <div class='line'>The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again</div>
      <div class='line'>I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant</div>
      <div class='line'>Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom</div>
      <div class='line'>The promise came that in his seed should all</div>
      <div class='line'>The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac</div>
      <div class='line'>Blessing with disappointed lips his first-born son,</div>
      <div class='line'>From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his warm affections and his devious ways,</div>
      <div class='line'>Flying before the wrath of Esau; how he</div>
      <div class='line'>Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams</div>
      <div class='line'>A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn</div>
      <div class='line'>Awe o’ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, ‘How</div>
      <div class='line'>Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I</div>
      <div class='line'>Knew it not.’ Of Joseph, once a mighty prince</div>
      <div class='line'>Within this land, who shrank in holy horror</div>
      <div class='line'>From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,</div>
      <div class='line'>And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord</div>
      <div class='line'>He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made</div>
      <div class='line'>His brethren swear that they would make his grave</div>
      <div class='line'>Among the patriarchs of his line, because</div>
      <div class='line'>Machpelah’s cave, where Abraham bowed before</div>
      <div class='line'>The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay</div>
      <div class='line'>His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his</div>
      <div class='line'>Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid</div>
      <div class='line'>The princely dead of Egypt.</div>
      <div class='line in4'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met</div>
      <div class='line'>Our father Jacob on his way, thy words</div>
      <div class='line'>Came back as messengers of light to guide</div>
      <div class='line'>My steps, and I refused to be called the son</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Pharaoh’s daughter. I saw the priests of On</div>
      <div class='line'>Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the princess’ face, while Pharaoh’s brow grew</div>
      <div class='line'>Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I</div>
      <div class='line'>Endured, as seeing him who hides his face</div>
      <div class='line'>Behind the brightness of his glory.</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt</div>
      <div class='line'>To cast my lot among the people of my race.”</div>

<h3 class='c001'>FLIGHT INTO MIDIAN.—<span class='sc'>Chapter III.</span></h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The love of Moses for his race soon found</div>
      <div class='line'>A stern expression. Pharaoh was building</div>
      <div class='line'>A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,</div>
      <div class='line'>He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.</div>
      <div class='line'>When he feared the growing power of Israel</div>
      <div class='line'>He stained his hands in children’s blood, and held</div>
      <div class='line'>A carnival of death in Goshen; but now</div>
      <div class='line'>He wished to hand his name and memory</div>
      <div class='line'>Down unto the distant ages, and instead</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lading that memory with the precious</div>
      <div class='line'>Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold</div>
      <div class='line'>And hard, and heartless as himself.</div>
      <div class='line in28'>And Israel was</div>
      <div class='line'>The fated race to whom the cruel tasks</div>
      <div class='line'>Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong</div>
      <div class='line'>And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,</div>
      <div class='line'>“These reports are ever harrowing my soul;</div>
      <div class='line'>I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Officers exact their labors, and see</div>
      <div class='line'>If these things be so—if they smite the feeble</div>
      <div class='line'>At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils</div>
      <div class='line'>Beyond their strength—if neither age nor sex</div>
      <div class='line'>Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And Moses went to see his brethren.</div>
      <div class='line in28'>’Twas eventide,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the laborers were wending their way</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto their lowly huts. ’Twas a sad sight,—</div>
      <div class='line'>The young girls walked without the bounding steps</div>
      <div class='line'>Of youth, with faces prematurely old,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises</div>
      <div class='line'>Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish</div>
      <div class='line'>Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say</div>
      <div class='line'>We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we’ve bent unto</div>
      <div class='line'>Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude</div>
      <div class='line'>And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast</div>
      <div class='line'>In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which seemed to say, to-day we bide our time,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only</div>
      <div class='line'>Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press</div>
      <div class='line'>Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;</div>
      <div class='line'>They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride</div>
      <div class='line'>And insolence, watching the laborers</div>
      <div class='line'>Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.</div>
      <div class='line'>And Moses’ heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly</div>
      <div class='line'>Musing, he sought a path that led him</div>
      <div class='line'>From the busy haunts of men. But even there</div>
      <div class='line'>The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard</div>
      <div class='line'>A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,</div>
      <div class='line'>And, looking back, he saw an officer</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand</div>
      <div class='line'>An aged man. Then Moses’ wrath o’erflowed</div>
      <div class='line'>His lips, and every nerve did tremble</div>
      <div class='line'>With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he</div>
      <div class='line'>Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou</div>
      <div class='line'>That aged man? His head is whiter than our</div>
      <div class='line'>Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy</div>
      <div class='line'>Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained</div>
      <div class='line'>Away their strength.” The Egyptian raised his eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute</div>
      <div class='line'>His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His</div>
      <div class='line'>Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he</div>
      <div class='line'>Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back</div>
      <div class='line'>To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses’ wrath o’erleaped the bounds</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled</div>
      <div class='line'>The smiter to the earth, and Israel had</div>
      <div class='line'>One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness</div>
      <div class='line'>Chase the flushes from the Egyptian’s face,</div>
      <div class='line'>The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance</div>
      <div class='line'>And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs;</div>
      <div class='line'>And when he knew that he was dead, he hid</div>
      <div class='line'>Him in the sand and left him to his rest.</div>
      <div class='line in18'>Another day Moses walked</div>
      <div class='line'>Abroad, and saw two brethren striving</div>
      <div class='line'>For mastery; and then his heart grew full</div>
      <div class='line'>Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more</div>
      <div class='line'>Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye</div>
      <div class='line'>Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”</div>
      <div class='line'>But they threw back his words in angry tones</div>
      <div class='line'>And asked if he had come to judge them, and would</div>
      <div class='line'>Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep</div>
      <div class='line'>His secret, that his life no more was safe</div>
      <div class='line'>In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Arabia and became a shepherd</div>
      <div class='line'>For the priest of Midian.</div>

      <div class='line in10'>Men grow strong in action, but in solitude</div>
      <div class='line'>Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away</div>
      <div class='line'>The bridge on which he has walked in safety</div>
      <div class='line'>To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat</div>
      <div class='line'>To Pharaoh’s throne, and did choose the calling</div>
      <div class='line'>Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became</div>
      <div class='line'>A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid</div>
      <div class='line'>The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he</div>
      <div class='line'>Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith</div>
      <div class='line'>In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe</div>
      <div class='line'>And race. Years stole o’er him, but they took</div>
      <div class='line'>No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face</div>
      <div class='line'>Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire</div>
      <div class='line'>That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened</div>
      <div class='line'>To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart</div>
      <div class='line'>Was just as faithful to his race as when he had</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood in Pharaoh’s courts and bade farewell</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto his daughter.</div>
      <div class='line'>There was a look of patient waiting on his face,</div>
      <div class='line'>A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted</div>
      <div class='line'>Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wings of some great destiny o’ershadowing</div>
      <div class='line'>All his life with strange and solemn glory.</div>
      <div class='line'>But the hour came when he must pass from thought</div>
      <div class='line'>To action,—when the hope of many years</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:</div>
      <div class='line'>One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw</div>
      <div class='line'>A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,—</div>
      <div class='line'>A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip</div>
      <div class='line'>The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;</div>
      <div class='line'>And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire</div>
      <div class='line'>Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was just as green and fresh as if the breath</div>
      <div class='line'>Of early spring were kissing every leaf.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Moses said I’ll turn aside to see</div>
      <div class='line'>This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice</div>
      <div class='line'>Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon his staff and spread his mantle o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty</div>
      <div class='line'>Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,</div>
      <div class='line'>By Horeb’s mount, his shrinking hands received</div>
      <div class='line'>The burden of his God, which bade him go</div>
      <div class='line'>To Egypt’s guilty king, and bid him let</div>
      <div class='line'>The oppressed go free.</div>
      <div class='line in26'>Commissioned thus</div>
      <div class='line'>He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought</div>
      <div class='line'>The tents of Jethro, and said “I pray thee</div>
      <div class='line'>Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;”</div>
      <div class='line'>And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought</div>
      <div class='line'>To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Yet there was a tender parting in that home;</div>
      <div class='line'>There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro</div>
      <div class='line'>And his daughters stood within the light of that</div>
      <div class='line'>Clear morn, and gave to Moses and his wife</div>
      <div class='line'>And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.</div>
      <div class='line'>For he had been a son and brother in that home</div>
      <div class='line'>Since first with manly courtesy he had filled</div>
      <div class='line'>The empty pails of Reuel’s daughters, and found</div>
      <div class='line'>A shelter ’neath his tent when flying from</div>
      <div class='line'>The wrath of Pharaoh.</div>
      <div class='line in24'>They journeyed on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back</div>
      <div class='line'>With tender love upon the home she had left,</div>
      <div class='line'>With all its precious memories crowding round</div>
      <div class='line'>Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking</div>
      <div class='line'>His path across the desert, longing once more</div>
      <div class='line'>To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,</div>
      <div class='line'>The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their</div>
      <div class='line'>Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon</div>
      <div class='line'>His youthful head their parting blessing. They</div>
      <div class='line'>Journeyed on till morning’s flush and noonday</div>
      <div class='line'>Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed</div>
      <div class='line'>Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning</div>
      <div class='line'>On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual</div>
      <div class='line'>Crowned, arose before him; and there he met</div>
      <div class='line'>His brother Aaron, sent by God to be</div>
      <div class='line'>His spokesman and to bear him company</div>
      <div class='line'>To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>They talked of home and friends until the lighter</div>
      <div class='line'>Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then they talked of Israel’s bondage,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the great deliverance about to dawn</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses</div>
      <div class='line'>Told him of the burning bush, and how the message</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus</div>
      <div class='line'>They talked until the risen moon had veiled</div>
      <div class='line'>The mount in soft and silvery light; and then</div>
      <div class='line'>They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed</div>
      <div class='line'>From sleep, pursued their way until they reached</div>
      <div class='line'>The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their race, and told them of the message</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their Father’s God. Then eager lips caught up</div>
      <div class='line'>The words of hope and passed the joyful “news</div>
      <div class='line'>Around, and all the people bowed their heads</div>
      <div class='line'>And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness</div>
      <div class='line'>To God.”</div>
      <div class='line in26'>That same day</div>
      <div class='line'>Moses sought an audience with the king. He found</div>
      <div class='line'>Him on his throne surrounded by the princes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage</div>
      <div class='line'>At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip</div>
      <div class='line'>And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew’s God,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has</div>
      <div class='line'>Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt</div>
      <div class='line'>For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt</div>
      <div class='line'>I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has</div>
      <div class='line'>Overflowed her banks and filled the land</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto</div>
      <div class='line'>Their God, then crept in want and sorrow</div>
      <div class='line'>To their graves. Surely Mizraim’s God is strong</div>
      <div class='line'>And Israel’s is weak; then wherefore should</div>
      <div class='line'>I heed his voice, or at his bidding break</div>
      <div class='line'>A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,</div>
      <div class='line'>And turned a deafened ear unto the words</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Moses and his brother, and yet he felt</div>
      <div class='line'>Strangely awed before their presence, because</div>
      <div class='line'>They stood as men who felt the grandeur</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,</div>
      <div class='line'>But of their message.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the next day Pharaoh called a council</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his mighty men, and before them laid</div>
      <div class='line'>The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeper of the palace and nearest lord</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the king, arose, and bending low</div>
      <div class='line'>Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.</div>
      <div class='line'>Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,</div>
      <div class='line'>With oily lips well versed in flattery</div>
      <div class='line'>And courtly speech, a supple reed ready</div>
      <div class='line'>To bend before his royal master’s lightest</div>
      <div class='line'>Breath—Pharaoh’s willing tool. He said</div>
      <div class='line'>“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient</div>
      <div class='line'>With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle</div>
      <div class='line'>And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now</div>
      <div class='line'>If thou would’st have these people dwell in peace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto</div>
      <div class='line'>Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added</div>
      <div class='line'>Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition</div>
      <div class='line'>And revolt.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh’s court,</div>
      <div class='line'>Arose. He was an aged man, whose white</div>
      <div class='line'>And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,</div>
      <div class='line'>And on his face a proud and evil look.</div>
      <div class='line'>He had been a servant to the former king,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wore his signet ring upon his hand.</div>
      <div class='line'>He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore</div>
      <div class='line'>Years ago Princess Charmian found him</div>
      <div class='line'>By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did</div>
      <div class='line'>Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all</div>
      <div class='line'>The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Within his veins, would rather be a servant</div>
      <div class='line'>Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>He thrust aside the honors of our dear</div>
      <div class='line'>Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,</div>
      <div class='line'>But for his daughter’s sake he let the trespass</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian</div>
      <div class='line'>In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he fled, it is said, unto the deserts</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks</div>
      <div class='line'>And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race</div>
      <div class='line'>To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition</div>
      <div class='line'>And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>That these men shall gather their own straw</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”</div>
      <div class='line'>And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his</div>
      <div class='line'>Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh</div>
      <div class='line'>Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen—</div>
      <div class='line'>That the laborers should gather their own straw,</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet they should not ’minish of their tale of bricks</div>
      <div class='line in20'>’Twas a sad day in Goshen;</div>
      <div class='line'>The king’s <a id='t28'></a>decree hung like a gloomy pall</div>
      <div class='line'>Around their homes. The people fainted ’neath</div>
      <div class='line'>Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,</div>
      <div class='line'>That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed</div>
      <div class='line'>A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are</div>
      <div class='line'>Idle, and your minds are filled with vain</div>
      <div class='line'>And foolish thoughts; get you unto your tasks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ye shall not ’minish of your tale of bricks.”</div>
      <div class='line in16'>And then they turned their eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis an old story now, but then ’twas new</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto the brethren,—how God’s anointed ones</div>
      <div class='line'>Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn</div>
      <div class='line'>To lines of living light; how hands that bring</div>
      <div class='line'>Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth</div>
      <div class='line'>Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows</div>
      <div class='line'>Now bright beneath the aureola of God,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.</div>
      <div class='line in18'>There was hope for Israel,</div>
      <div class='line'>But they did not see the golden fringes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Grey sky, and fainted ’neath the cheerless gloom.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Moses sought again the presence of the king:</div>
      <div class='line'>And Pharaoh’s brow grew dark with wrath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rising up in angry haste, he said,</div>
      <div class='line'>Defiantly, “If thy God be great, show</div>
      <div class='line'>Us some sign or token of his power.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>And it trembled with a sign of life;</div>
      <div class='line'>The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing</div>
      <div class='line'>Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,</div>
      <div class='line'>And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful</div>
      <div class='line'>Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth</div>
      <div class='line'>From Moses’ side, lay coiled and panting</div>
      <div class='line'>At the monarch’s feet. With wonder open-eyed</div>
      <div class='line'>The king gazed on the changed rod, then called</div>
      <div class='line'>For his magicians—wily men, well versed</div>
      <div class='line'>In sinful lore—and bade them do the same.</div>
      <div class='line'>And they, leagued with the powers of night, did</div>
      <div class='line'>Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses’</div>
      <div class='line'>Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss</div>
      <div class='line'>And angry gulp, he swallowed the living things</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses</div>
      <div class='line'>Show that Israel’s God had greater power</div>
      <div class='line'>Than those dark sons of night.</div>
      <div class='line in22'>But not by this alone</div>
      <div class='line'>Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed</div>
      <div class='line'>Their waters; every fountain, well and pool</div>
      <div class='line'>Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.</div>
      <div class='line'>And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life:</div>
      <div class='line'>Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream—they clogged</div>
      <div class='line'>The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred</div>
      <div class='line'>Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh’s bed, and hopped</div>
      <div class='line'>Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his</div>
      <div class='line'>Ovens and his pans.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;</div>
      <div class='line'>They were gray and creeping things, that made</div>
      <div class='line'>Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre</div>
      <div class='line'>Spots—things so loathsome in the land they did</div>
      <div class='line'>Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest</div>
      <div class='line'>Dared to lift his hand to any god with one</div>
      <div class='line'>Of these upon him. And then the sky grew</div>
      <div class='line'>Dark, as if a cloud were passing o’er its</div>
      <div class='line'>Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.</div>
      <div class='line'>The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail</div>
      <div class='line'>Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,</div>
      <div class='line'>With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire</div>
      <div class='line'>Had scorched it through,</div>
      <div class='line in28'>Then angry blains</div>
      <div class='line'>And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man</div>
      <div class='line'>And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron</div>
      <div class='line'>Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light</div>
      <div class='line'>Divided day from morn, nor told the passage</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat</div>
      <div class='line'>In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a burden</div>
      <div class='line'>On the air,—a darkness one might almost gather</div>
      <div class='line'>In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came</div>
      <div class='line'>The last dread plague—the death of the first-born.</div>
      <div class='line in28'>’Twas midnight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a startling shriek rose from each palace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Of dread, as if the mystic angels wing</div>
      <div class='line'>Had chilled the very air with horror.</div>
      <div class='line'>Death! Death! was everywhere—in every home</div>
      <div class='line'>A corpse—in every heart a bitter woe.</div>
      <div class='line'>There were anxious fingerings for the pulse</div>
      <div class='line'>That ne’er would throb again, and eager listenings</div>
      <div class='line'>For some sound of life—a hurrying to and fro—</div>
      <div class='line'>Then burning kisses on the cold lips</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>And deep and heavy groans throughout the length</div>
      <div class='line'>And breadth of Egypt. ’Twas the last dread plague,</div>
      <div class='line'>But it had snapped in twain the chains on which</div>
      <div class='line'>The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;</div>
      <div class='line'>Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste</div>
      <div class='line'>From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed</div>
      <div class='line'>To see them gather up their flocks and herds,</div>

      <div class='line'>But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning</div>
      <div class='line'>From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt’s wail</div>
      <div class='line'>Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had</div>
      <div class='line'>Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped</div>
      <div class='line'>Near Baalzephn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with my chariots and my warlike men</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll bring them back, or mete them out their graves.”</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Then Pharaoh’s officers arose</div>
      <div class='line'>And gathered up the armies of the king</div>
      <div class='line'>And made his chariots ready for pursuit.</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him</div>
      <div class='line'>Rode his mighty men, their banners floating</div>
      <div class='line'>On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering</div>
      <div class='line'>In the morning light; and Israel saw,</div>
      <div class='line'>With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their</div>
      <div class='line'>Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;</div>
      <div class='line'>Children hid their faces in their mothers’ robes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And strong men bowed their heads in agony and dread;</div>
      <div class='line'>And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast</div>
      <div class='line'>Brought us here to die?”</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow</div>
      <div class='line'>With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts</div>
      <div class='line'>Be strong and they should his salvation see.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Stand still,” said Moses to the fearful throng</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose hearts were fainting in the wild, “Stand still.”</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah, that was Moses’ word, but higher and greater</div>
      <div class='line'>Came God’s watchword for the hour, and not for that</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone, but all the coming hours of time.</div>
      <div class='line'>“Speak ye unto the people and bid them</div>
      <div class='line'>Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters</div>
      <div class='line'>And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote</div>
      <div class='line'>The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then lay as calm and still as lips that just</div>
      <div class='line'>Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted</div>
      <div class='line'>Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Way was God’s own wondrous masonry;</div>
      <div class='line'>The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild</div>
      <div class='line'>Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light</div>
      <div class='line'>To Israel’s path. Madly rushed the hosts</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Pharaoh upon the people’s track, when</div>
      <div class='line'>The solemn truth broke on them—that God</div>
      <div class='line'>For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror</div>
      <div class='line'>Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let</div>
      <div class='line'>Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God</div>
      <div class='line'>Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side.”</div>
      <div class='line'>They had trusted in their chariots, but now</div>
      <div class='line'>That hope was vain; God had loosened every</div>
      <div class='line'>Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each</div>
      <div class='line'>Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still</div>
      <div class='line'>With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered</div>
      <div class='line'>And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,</div>
      <div class='line'>And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er their heads, for the waves began to tremble</div>
      <div class='line'>And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose</div>
      <div class='line'>A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,</div>
      <div class='line'>A gurgling sound of horror, as “the waves</div>
      <div class='line'>Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking</div>
      <div class='line'>Out their place again,” and the flower and pride</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Upon the shore, and the song of Israel.</div>
      <div class='line'>Triumph was the requiem of their foes.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs</div>
      <div class='line'>And down the valleys, o’er the dark and restless</div>
      <div class='line'>Sea, rose the people’s shout of triumph, going</div>
      <div class='line'>Up in praise to God, and the very air</div>
      <div class='line'>Seemed joyous for the choral song of millions</div>
      <div class='line'>Throbbed upon its viewless wings.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then another song of triumph rose in accents</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft and clear; “’twas the voice of Moses’ sister</div>
      <div class='line'>Rising in the tide of song.” The warm blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;</div>
      <div class='line'>The roses of her girlhood were flushing</div>
      <div class='line'>On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor</div>
      <div class='line'>Of long departed days, for time itself seemed</div>
      <div class='line'>Pausing, and she lived the past again; again</div>
      <div class='line'>The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,</div>
      <div class='line'>A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;</div>
      <div class='line'>The tender tide of rapture swept o’er her soul again</div>
      <div class='line'>She had felt when Pharaoh’s daughter had claimed</div>
      <div class='line'>Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy</div>
      <div class='line'>Above her rescued son. Then again she saw</div>
      <div class='line'>Him choosing “’twixt Israel’s pain and sorrow</div>
      <div class='line'>And Egypt’s pomp and pride.” But now he stood</div>
      <div class='line'>Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud</div>
      <div class='line'>She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women</div>
      <div class='line'>In music, dance and song, as they shouted out</div>
      <div class='line'>Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains.</div>

      <div class='line'>To lead them back where they might bind anew</div>
      <div class='line'>Their broken chains, when God arose and shut</div>
      <div class='line'>The gates of promise on their lives, and left</div>
      <div class='line'>Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia’s desert sands</div>
      <div class='line'>But though they slumbered in the wild, they died</div>
      <div class='line'>With broader freedom on their lips, and for their</div>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE MISSION OF THE FLOWERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In a lovely garden, filled with fair and blooming
flowers, stood a beautiful rose tree. It was the centre
of attraction, and won the admiration of every eye;
its beauteous flowers were sought to adorn the bridal
wreath and deck the funeral bier. It was a thing of
joy and beauty, and its earth mission was a blessing.
Kind hands plucked its flowers to gladden the chamber
of sickness and adorn the prisoner’s lonely cell.
Young girls wore them ’mid their clustering curls, and
grave brows relaxed when they gazed upon their wondrous
beauty. Now the rose was very kind and generous
hearted, and, seeing how much joy she dispensed,
wished that every flower could only be a rose, and like
herself have the privilege of giving joy to the children
of men; and while she thus mused, a bright and lovely
spirit approached her and said, “I know thy wishes
and will grant thy desires. Thou shalt have power
to change every flower in the garden to thine own
likeness. When the soft winds come wooing thy
fairest buds and flowers, thou shalt breathe gently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>o’er thy sister plants, and beneath thy influence they
shall change to beautiful roses.” The rose tree
bowed her head in silent gratitude to the gentle being
who had granted her this wondrous power. All night
the stars bent over her from their holy homes above,
but she scarcely heeded their vigils. The gentle dews
nestled in her arms and kissed the cheeks of her
daughters; but she hardly noticed them;—she was
waiting for the soft airs to awaken and seek her
charming abode. At length the gentle airs greeted
her, and she hailed them with a joyous welcome, and
then commenced her work of change. The first object
that met her vision was a tulip superbly arrayed in
scarlet and gold. When she was aware of the intention
of her neighbor, her cheeks flamed with anger,
her eyes flashed indignantly, and she haughtily refused
to change her proud robes for the garb the rose tree
had prepared for her; but she could not resist the spell
that was upon her, and she passively permitted the
garments of the rose to enfold her yielding limbs. The
verbenas saw the change that had fallen upon the tulip
and dreading that a similar fate awaited them, crept
closely to the ground, and, while tears gathered in their
eyes, they felt a change pass through their sensitive
frames, and instead of gentle verbenas they were
blushing roses. She breathed upon the sleepy poppies;
a deeper slumber fell upon their senses, and when they
awoke, they too had changed to bright and beautiful
roses. The heliotrope read her fate in the lot of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>sisters, and, bowing her fair head in silent sorrow,
gracefully submitted to her unwelcome destiny. The
violets, whose mission was to herald the approach of
spring, were averse to losing their identity. “Surely,”
said they, “we have a mission as well as the rose;”
but with heavy hearts they saw themselves changed
like their sister plants. The snow drop drew around
her her robes of virgin white; she would not willingly
exchange them for the most brilliant attire that ever
decked a flower’s form; to her they were the emblems
of purity and innocence; but the rose tree breathed
upon her, and with a bitter sob she reluctantly consented
to the change. The dahlias lifted their heads
proudly and defiantly; they dreaded the change, but
scorned submission; they loved the fading year, and
wished to spread around his dying couch their brightest,
fairest flowers; but vainly they struggled, the doom
was upon them, and they could not escape. A modest
lily that grew near the rose tree shrank instinctively
from her; but it was in vain, and with tearful eyes
and trembling limbs she yielded, while a quiver of
agony convulsed her frame. The marygolds sighed
submissively and made no remonstrance. The garden
pinks grew careless, and submitted without a murmur,
while other flowers, less fragrant or less fair, paled with
sorrow or reddened with anger; but the spell of the
rose tree was upon them, and every flower was changed
by her power, and that once beautiful garden was overrun
with roses; it had become a perfect wilderness of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>roses; the garden had changed, but that variety which
had lent it so much beauty was gone, and men grew
tired of roses, for they were everywhere. The smallest
violet peeping faintly from its bed would have been
welcome, the humblest primrose would have been
hailed with delight,—even a dandelion would have
been a harbinger of joy; and when the rose saw that
the children of men were dissatisfied with the change
she had made, her heart grew sad within her, and she
wished the power had never been given her to change
her sister plants to roses, and tears came into her eyes
as she mused, when suddenly a rough wind shook her
drooping form, and she opened her eyes and found that
she had only been dreaming. But an important
lesson had been taught; she had learned to respect
the individuality of her sister flowers, and began to
see that they, as well as herself, had their own missions,—some
to gladden the eye with their loveliness and
thrill the soul with delight; some to transmit fragrance
to the air; others to breathe a refining influence upon
the world; some had power to lull the aching brow
and soothe the weary heart and brain into forgetfulness;
and of those whose mission she did not understand,
she wisely concluded there must be some object
in their creation, and resolved to be true to her own
earth mission, and lay her fairest buds and flowers
upon the altars of love and truth.</p>
